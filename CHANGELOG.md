## v0.4.1 - 2024-06-18

- Updated ghcr.io/txqueuelen/powerdns-docker/powerdns to v4.9.1

## v0.4.0 - 2024-06-17

### Note
All the previous release contain no changelog as it was no automation.
I am solving this with this PR/release/automation that automates the generation of change logs and releases.
I am leveraging this 0ver to do a breaking change. I am changing the URL for this chart from oci://ghcr.io/txqueuelen/charts to oci://ghcr.io/txqueuelen/pdns-stateless.
It seemed that is awesome to have all charts on the same path and loved that Github supported it but I found that is hard to follow the origin of a chart. Users expect to have the chart in a repository called `charts`.
This breaking change should not affect too much as almost no user is using this release note is a way of documenting the changes.
Luckily there are only a few 0ver releases from here once we merge all dependencies that need to be upgraded and make the last changes before creating the v1 release :D

### üöÄ Enhancements
- Automatic dependency upgrade and release system
